This is a list of other people/pages in the technology field (and a few people outside of that field) that I follow. Most of these are blogs. I'll include a couple posts I think are particularly good for some of these. I'll update the list as I go. 

- [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/)
    - Her career/work pages are especially good, because there's a lot of stuff about career progression that no one talks about. The tech stuff is great too, because she's honest about what she knows and how she got there. Her page has done a lot to combat the imposter syndrome I sometimes get from being in the industry.

- [Daniel Bader](https://dbader.org/)
    - His [reading list](https://dbader.org/blog/my-favourite-books-about-programming) is great. There's also some really solid Python development advice here. 

<br>

- [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/index)
    - The author of the [Flask Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) has some great advice on Python development in general.

<br>

- [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/index.html)
    - The former Viaweb and Y Combinator founder has a lot of great essays on startups, productivity, and innovation. 

<br>

- [The Uber Engineering Blog](https://eng.uber.com/)
    - A lot of this goes way over my head. It's aimed at senior engineers dealing with problems at a scale I'm not accustomed to. Still, there's a lot of great information here, even if I don't get all of it.

- [John Carmack's Twitter](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack)
    - The former Id Software founder has a lot of great thoughts on graphics programming, the game industry, aerospace, and machine learning. It's just a shame it's on Twitter.
