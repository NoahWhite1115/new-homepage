## About me:

I'm a software engineer from Sacramento, CA. I went to UC Davis. Now living in the Bay Area. I'm really interested in games and a whole bunch of other things. 

## About this blog:

This is a blog where I'll be sharing whatever I'm working on. Honestly, I'd be surprised if anyone ever actually reads this. The purpose of this blog is mostly so that I have a place to gather my thoughts and format my notes into something legible.  

Also, this blog is a place for me to become a better technical writer. It's not a particularly strong technical skill for me and it's one I'd like to develop. An essential part of learning to program is writing more code, right? And so an essential part of learning to write better is obviously writing more.
